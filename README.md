YSC2239: Introduction to Data Science | Final Project

We are looking at a data about penalty shootouts in the mainstream Football Leagues all over the world. Some of the research questions we arelooking at include: 
1. Do the league, time the penalty is taken and away/home status affect its success rate? 
2. Are penalties scored after 75th minute more likely to change the outcome of the game? 
3. Does playerâ€™s position determine their success rate?
